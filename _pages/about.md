* Hello, I am HangZhang, a MPhil student majoring in Statistics at the Nanjing Normal University[(NNU)](http://www.njnu.edu.cn/), who will graduate in **June 2024**. Currently, I am doing research about Partially linear single index model supervised by [Prof.Fengchang Xie](http://math.njnu.edu.cn/info/1011/6281.htm) in the Statistical and Financial Mathematics Laboratory.


* Before that, I was a undergraduate student of Anhui University of Finance and Economics(AUFE), I have been awarded the Bachelor's degree of Mathematics with First Class Honours and the second Bachelor's degree of Financial Engineering from AUFE in July 2021.


* I started learning computer programming in college, and I like it. I am skillful with **Python**, it is open source and has many packages, that can help me realize mathematical and statistical numerical simulation conveniently. Besides, I can also use Matlab, R, etc. by doing some paperwork necessarily.


* My **research interests** are primarily in the area of statistical machine learning and survival analysis.


* To learn more about me, you can have a view of my [CV page](https://hangzhangstat.com/cv/), or directly download my resume: [Chinese version](../files/张航_中文简历.pdf) or [English version](../files/ZhangHang_EnglishCV.pdf).
